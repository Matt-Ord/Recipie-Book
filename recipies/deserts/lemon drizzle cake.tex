        \item \grams{225} caster sugar
        \item 4 eggs
        \item \grams{225} flour

        \item 1 1/2 lemons, juiced
        \item \grams{85} caster sugar
    \end{subingredient}

\begin{recipe}
    \step{Preheat the oven to 180°C}
    \step{Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through.}
    \step{Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined.}
    \step{Line a loaf tin (8 \(\times \) 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.}
    \step{Bake for 45--50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.}
    \step{While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemons juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle.}
    \step{Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle – the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping.}
    \step{Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 3--4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.}
