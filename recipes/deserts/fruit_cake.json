    "Cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes, and test with a toothpick. When it comes out clean the cake is done. If not, return to the oven for 10 minutes and repeat. You may need up to 1 hour 45 mins.",
    "Take the cake out of the oven and leave in the tin for 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool. Store in an airtight box when cool."
