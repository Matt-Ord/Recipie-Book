  "steps": [
    "Finely chop pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate pecorino and parmesan and mix them together.",
    "Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with pepper. Mix the cheese with egg and set everything aside.",
    "Add spaghetti to a pot of boiling water. Cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente.",
    "Fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.",
    "Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, until the pancetta is golden and crisp.",
    "When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a fork and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta.",
    "Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Quickly pour in the eggs and cheese, lifting up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture.",
    "Add extra pasta water to keep it saucy. Season with salt and serve."
