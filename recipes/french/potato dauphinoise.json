  "steps": [
    "Preheat the oven to 190°C",
    "Tip 500ml double cream, 500ml milk and 3 garlic cloves into a large saucepan and bring to a simmer.",
    "Slice 8 large potatoes very finely, about 3--4mm, add them to the cream and simmer for 3 mins until just cooked.",
    "Gently stir to separate the potato and stop it sinking and catching on the bottom of the pan.",
    "Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon and place in a wide shallow ovenproof dish so that they are about 5cm in depth.",
    "Pour over the garlic infused cream (discarding the garlic) – just enough to seep through the layers and leave a little moisture on the surface.",
    "Scatter over 100g grated gruyère cheese, if using, then bake for 30 mins until the potatoes are soft and browned – increase the heat for 5 mins if not brown enough."
