# Roasted Ham

Prep Time: 20 min

Cook Time: 120 min

Serves: 5

## Ingredients

- 1 ham on the bone
- english mustard
- 3 tbsp demerara sugar

## Method

- Cover the ham completely with cold water and leave for as many hours as the supplier recommends.
- Remove the ham from the soaking water and place it in a baking tray wrapped in foil to create a `tent effect'. Bake the ham in a pre-heated oven at 160°C, for 20 minutes per 450 g.
- Thirty minutes before the end of the cooking time, remove the ham from the oven and turn the oven up to 220°C. take the skin off the ham – make a cut with a sharp knife right along the length of the ham, then slide the knife beneath the skin and peel it away, leaving behind as much fat as you can.
- score the fat in a diamond pattern and stud each center with a clove. Spread English mustard all over the surface of the ham.
- Sprinkle about 3 heaped tablespoons of demerara sugar all over and press it on to the mustard with your hands. Place the ham, uncovered, back into the hot oven for another 30 minutes, or until the surface has a glazed golden crust.
