# Potato Dauphinoise

Prep Time: 20 min

Cook Time: 45 min

Serves: 6

## Ingredients

- 8 large king Edward potatoes
- 500 ml double cream
- 500 ml milk
- 150 ml vegetable stock
- 100 g gruyère cheese

## Method

- Preheat the oven to 190°C
- Tip 500ml double cream, 500ml milk and 3 garlic cloves into a large saucepan and bring to a simmer.
- Slice 8 large potatoes very finely, about 3--4mm, add them to the cream and simmer for 3 mins until just cooked.
- Gently stir to separate the potato and stop it sinking and catching on the bottom of the pan.
- Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon and place in a wide shallow ovenproof dish so that they are about 5cm in depth.
- Pour over the garlic infused cream (discarding the garlic) – just enough to seep through the layers and leave a little moisture on the surface.
- Scatter over 100g grated gruyère cheese, if using, then bake for 30 mins until the potatoes are soft and browned – increase the heat for 5 mins if not brown enough.
