# Beef Stew

Prep Time: 20 min

Cook Time: 120 min

Serves: 4
## Ingredients
* 750 grams beef steak
* 2 tbsp flour
* 2 cloves garlic
* 175 grams onions
* 150 grams celery
* 150 grams carrots
* 2 leeks
* 200 grams swede
* 150 ml red wine
* 500 ml beef stock
* 2 bay leaves
* 3 tbsp fresh thyme
* 3 tbsp fresh parsley
* Worcestershire sauce

### dumplings
* 125 grams plain flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 60 grams suet


## Method
* Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
* For the beef stew, heat the oil and butter in an ovenproof casserole and fry the beef until browned on all sides.
* Sprinkle over the flour and cook for a further 2--3 minutes. Add the garlic and all the vegetables and fry for 1--2 minutes.
* Stir in the wine, stock and herbs, then add the Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar, to taste. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
* Cover with a lid, transfer to the oven and cook for about two hours, or until the meat is tender.
* For the dumplings, sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Add the suet and enough water to form a thick dough.
* With floured hands, roll spoonfuls of the dough into small balls.
* After two hours, remove the lid from the stew and place the balls on top of the stew. Cover, return to the oven and cook for a further 20 minutes, or until the dumplings have puffed up and are tender. (If you prefer your dumplings with a golden top, leave the lid off when returning to the oven.)
* To serve, place a spoonful of mashed potato onto each of four serving plates and top with the stew and dumplings. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.
