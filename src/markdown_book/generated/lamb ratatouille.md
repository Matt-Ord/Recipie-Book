Cook Time: 120 min

Serves: 6
## Ingredients
* large leg of lamb
* 3 tbsp thyme
* 1 tbsp paprika
* 2 tbsp olive oli
* 2 cloves garlic
* 3 onions
* 2 red peppers
* 1 large aubergine
* 1 tin chopped tomatoes
* 300 ml chicken stock
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 3 bay leaves
* 1 tbsp honey


## Method
* Preheat the oven to 200°C.
* Using a small sharp knife, make a series of small slits over the leg of lamb. Put 2 tablespoons of the thyme in a bowl with the paprika and oil, season and mix together. Spread the mixture over the lamb, insert the garlic slivers into the slits and season the lamb with salt and pepper. Put the onions into a large, deep roasting tin, sit the lamb on top and roast for about 40 minutes.
* Reduce the oven temperature to 160°C
* Scatter the peppers and aubergine around the lamb. Pour the tomatoes into a bowl, add the stock, tomato paste, the remaining thyme, bay leaves and honey, and stir to combine. Pour into the tin over the peppers and stir. Cover the whole tin with foil and return to the oven for about 4 hours, until the lamb is tender and falling off the bone.
* Lift the lamb out of the tin and place on a large board. Spoon off any fat from the top of the sauce. Carve the meat into slices and serve with the vegetables.
