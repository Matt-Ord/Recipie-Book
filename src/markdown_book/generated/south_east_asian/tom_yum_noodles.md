## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Noodles:** Soak the rice noodles in warm water according to the package instructions (usually 15-20 minutes) until flexible. Drain and set aside.
2. **Infuse the Broth:** In a large pot, bring the stock to a boil. Add the lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and galangal. Let it simmer for 5 minutes until the broth becomes fragrant.
3. **Add the Paste:** Stir in the Tom yum paste until fully dissolved. Add the mushrooms and minced protein, stirring to break up the meat into small crumbles.
4. **Cook the Seafood/Protein:** Add the shrimp or sliced chicken. Simmer for 2-3 minutes until the protein is just cooked through.
5. **Final Seasoning:** Turn off the heat. Stir in the fish sauce, sugar, and lime juice. **Taste the broth**—it should be a balanced hit of spicy, sour, and salty.
6. **Quick Blanch:** Quickly boil the soaked noodles and bean sprouts in a separate pot of water for 1-2 minutes. Drain and divide into serving bowls.
7. **Assemble:** Ladle the hot soup and proteins over the noodles.
8. **Garnish:** Top each bowl with crushed peanuts, cilantro, and spring onions. Serve immediately while piping hot.
