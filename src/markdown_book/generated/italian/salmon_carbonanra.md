# Salmon Carbonara

Prep Time: 10 min

Cook Time: 10 min

Serves: 2
## Ingredients
* 200 g spaghetti
* 1 tsp butter
* 1 clove garlic
* 150 ml double cream
* 2 eggs
* 3 tbsp parmesan
* 120 g smoked salmon
* chives to garnish


## Method
* Cook the spaghetti. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small pan, add the garlic and gently sizzle for 1 min. Remove from the heat.
* Lightly beat the cream, eggs, softened garlic and half the Parmesan in a bowl. Stir in the smoked salmon trimmings.
* Drain the pasta well and return to the pan. Add the salmon mixture and the chives, then toss well so the heat from the pasta lightly thickens the sauce.
* Serve scattered with the remaining Parmesan and plenty of black pepper.
