# Spaghetti Carbonanra

Prep Time: 15 min

Cook Time: 15 min

Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 100 g pancetta
- \grams{50g} pecorino
- 3 large eggs
- 350 g spaghetti
- 4 cloves garlic

## Method

- Finely chop pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate pecorino and parmesan and mix them together.
- Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with pepper. Mix the cheese with egg and set everything aside.
- Add spaghetti to a pot of boiling water. Cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente.
- Fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.
- Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, until the pancetta is golden and crisp.
- When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a fork and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta.
- Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Quickly pour in the eggs and cheese, lifting up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture.
- Add extra pasta water to keep it saucy. Season with salt and serve.
