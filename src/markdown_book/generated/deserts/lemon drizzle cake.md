# Lemon Drizzle Cake

Prep Time: 15 min

Cook Time: 45 min

Serves: 5
## Ingredients
* 225 grams butter
* 225 grams caster sugar
* 4 eggs
* 225 grams flour
* 1 lemon

### topping
* 1 1/2 lemons, juiced
* 85 grams caster sugar


## Method
* Preheat the oven to 180°C
* Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through.
* Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined.
* Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.
* Bake for 45--50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.
* While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemons juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle.
* Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle – the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping.
* Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 3--4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.
