# Chocolate Roulade

Prep Time: 30 min

Cook Time: 20 min

Serves: 8
## Ingredients
* 175 grams plain chocolate
* 175 grams caster sugar
* 6 large eggs
* 2 tbsp cocoa powder
* 300 ml double cream
* icing sugar


## Method
* Preheat the oven to 180°C
* Add sugar and egg yolks to a large bowl and whisk until creamy.
* In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Stir a large spoonful of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture. Mix gently, then fold in the remaining egg whites and the sieved cocoa powder. Spread evenly in the prepared tin. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes until firm.
* Remove the cake from the oven, leave in the tin, cover with a dry tea towel and leave until cold.
* Whip the cream until it just holds its shape and dust a large piece of greaseproof paper with sifted icing sugar. Turn out the roulade and peel off the paper. Spread with the cream. Score a mark 2.5cm in along the short edge, then roll up very tightly like a swiss roll, using the paper to help. Do not worry when the roulade cracks – a good one should! Dust with more sifted icing sugar to serve.
